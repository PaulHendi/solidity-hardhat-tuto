Arbitrage between USDC/ETH 0.3% fee pool and USDC/ETH 0.05% fee pool.

For this challenge, we will

Borrow USDC from one pool
Swap USDC back to WETH in another pool
Repay first pool with WETH
If the amount of WETH bought back in step 2 is greater than the amount repaid in step 3, then there is profit from the the arbitrage. Otherwise there was a loss.
