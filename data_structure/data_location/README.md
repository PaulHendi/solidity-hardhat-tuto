Variables are stored in one of three places.

storage - variable is a state variable (store on blockchain)
memory - variable is in memory and it exists temporary during a function call
calldata - special data location that contains function arguments
Difference between memory and calldata
calldata is like memory but not modifiable. calldata saves gas.
