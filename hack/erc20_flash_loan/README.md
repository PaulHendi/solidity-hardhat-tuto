# LendingPool is offering ERC20 flash loans for free.

One of my favorite exploit. Based on the fact that the lending pool contract can call any function on behalf of the sender, so the sender ask the contract to approve himself the whole token balance of the contract. He can then transfer the whole balance of the lending pool contract to himself.
